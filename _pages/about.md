Hi. My name is Jatuporn Toy Leksut. I'm a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">USC</a>. I was previously at <a href="https://iris.usc.edu/usc-computer-vision.html">Computer Vision Lab</a> working on Face Recognition and Facial Expression Analysis. I'm now with <a href="http://ilab.usc.edu/">iLab</a> working on Object Recognition using Deep Learning. My research interests include Computer Vision &#8745; Computer Graphics.
